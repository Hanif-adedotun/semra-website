          To impact academic and moral knowledge of Islam to the children with
          the Quran, Hadith and other relevant Islamic literatures. Islamiyyah
          was restructured in January 2016 when classes were created, syllabus
          developed, structures were put in place and new set of staff were
          recruited to run the Islamiyyah. Our priority remains impacting in our
          pupilsâ€™ Islamic knowledge and morals which can only be achieved by the
          cooperation of the parents/guardians and the authorities at the
          Islamiyyah. Thank you for trusting us with your wards.
